Web application project<br>
Build a basic Flask server that has a REST API to perform CRUD operations include one database table and
a web interface.<br>

The repository contains:
* This `README.md` file
* Files that form the Web application project option.

1. `.gitignore` - includes reference to config.py and venv, so that when it is downloaded, the repository won't damage that person's own configuration.
2. `config.py` - the purpose of the configuration file is to create the initial settings for the project, thus avoiding hardcoded data.  
A newuser can amend this file to include their own local settings (e.g., user name and password) before proceeding.
3. `requirements.txt` - what is needed is set out clearly in this separate file. 
It used for specifying what python packages (and versions) are required to run this project. 
To install your packages using requirements.txt:

* Open a terminal or command prompt<br>
* Navigate to the folder with requirements.txt<br>
* run: pip install -r requirements.txt<br>
* Installation of dependencies is complete.<br>

4. `server.py` - The server programme is simple, with the “heavy lifting” carried out in the DAO.
5. `stockDAO.py` - The programme that consumes an API, it defines the standard CRUD operations to be performed.
6. `testStockDAO.py`- included to show the process, this programme was used to test the DAO.
7. `index.html` - Accompanying web interface, uses AJAX calls, to perform these CRUD operations is saved in the `staticpages` folder
8. `foodie.ico` - a favicon that provides a small food themed image displayed in the browser address bar of index.html
9.`initdb.sql`- the sql code to create a database similar to the one used in this project
